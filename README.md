This is a python project to extract all bycecle shops from a osm map file and put those locations in a sqllite database.
Now there are better/faster tools out there to filter for example shops from a osm file and put those in a seperate osm file of their own.
This tool will also put tose in a database.
It might be a good example of how to work with osm data in python.
